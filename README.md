# soundscape
This repository contains scripts and information to reproduce the results from global soundscape data.
Scripts are in 3 zip files that open to separate directories pipeline, scripts, and figscripts.

![Slide1](https://github.com/psomervuo/soundscape/assets/39729972/9d434ea3-85dc-4b1e-ac4e-f367e08c6e37)

The data to run the statistical analyses and produce figures (step 3 in figure above) is in zip file 'datatable.zip' that will be available once the data are published.

Note: three binaries (convertLifeplanFileFormat, audioMothName, readHeaderDAT) are not included in pipeline.gz since they contain private data encryption key to convert DAT files into WAV files. However, when starting data processing from WAV files, they are not needed.
